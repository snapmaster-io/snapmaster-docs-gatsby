# Slack

## Connection

### Connection type

The Slack connection type is **oauth**.  

### Entity name

The Slack connection entity is named **workspaces**.

### Connection info ###

Slack supports OAuth2 as the primary authentication mechanism.  When you 
connect Slack, it stores the OAuth2 access token for the workspace that you 
authorize as the default Slack credentials.  These credentials are accessed 
by setting the `workspace` parameter to any Slack action to `slack:workspaces:default`.

In addition, the Slack provider supports adding more workspaces through 
("legacy") access tokens.  To add another named workspace, supply the following 
information:

| name      | description           | type     |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------|
| workspace | workspace name        | name     |
| token     | personal access token | password |

**Note: you do not have to add a workspace via a personal access token in 
order to use the Slack default credentials, that come from the OAuth2 flow that 
is used to connect Slack.**

## Triggers

The Slack provider currently does not have any events.

## Actions

The Slack provider exposes the following actions:

| name | description                 |
|------|-----------------------------|
| send | send a message to a channel |

Parameters:

| name      | description        | entity           | required |
|-----------|--------------------|------------------|----------|

| channel   | channel to send to |                  | true     |
