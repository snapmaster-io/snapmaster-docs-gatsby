# SnapMaster 
## Master your DevOps toolchain

SnapMaster is the definitive DevOps integration platform.  

This repository contains the SnapMaster documentation, built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and Rocketseat's [gatsby-theme-docs](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gatsby-themes/tree/master/@rocketseat/gatsby-theme-docs).

## Running docs locally

`gatsby develop` in the root directory of this project will run an HTTP server on localhost:8000.

## Building docs

`gatsby build` will build the static documentation website in the `public/` subdirectory.

## Deploying on Netlify

[docs.snapmaster.io](https://docs.snapmaster.io) is currently deployed on Netlify.

The Netlify configuration file `netlify.toml` contains the commands  
that Netlify uses as part of the deployment process.
