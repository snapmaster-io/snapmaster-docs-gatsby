## Running docs locally

`gatsby develop` in the root directory of this project will run an HTTP server on localhost:8000.

## Building docs

`gatsby build` will build the static documentation website in the `public/` subdirectory.

## Deploying on Netlify

that Netlify uses as part of the deployment process.
